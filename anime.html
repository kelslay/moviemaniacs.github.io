  <h3>
    Miss Hokusai
  </h3>

<body>
  <p><strong>Platform:</strong>Netflix</p>
  <p><strong>Rotten Tomatoes Score:</strong> 92%</p>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong>PG-13</p>
  <p><strong>Watch </strong>the trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg0dJUvFgAg">here</a>
  <p><strong>Actors:</strong> Anne Watanabe, Kumiko Asou, Gaku Hamada</p>
  <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong>As all of Edo flocks to see the work of the revered painter Hokusai, his daughter
    O-Ei toils diligently inside his studio. Her masterful portraits, dragons and erotic sketches- sold under the
    name of her father- are coveted by upper crust Lords and journeyman print makers alike. Shy and reserved in public,
    in the studio O-Ei is as brash and uninhibited as her father, smoking a pipe while sketching drawings that would make
    contemporary Japanese ladies blush. But despite this fiercely independent spirit, O-Ei struggles under the domineering
    influence of her father and is ridiculed for lacking the life experience that she is attempting to portray in her art.
    Miss Hokusai's bustling Edo (present day Tokyo) is filled with yokai spirits, dragons, and conniving tradesmen, while
    O-Ei's relationships with her demanding father and blind younger sister provide a powerful emotional underpinning to this
    sumptuously-animated coming-of-age tale.
